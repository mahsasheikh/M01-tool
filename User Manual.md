## **Hybrid Generation**

In this section, you'll learn how to generate hybrid molecules using M01 tool. Follow the steps below to create your hybrids.

### **Steps for Hybrid Generation:**

1. **Enter the Main SMILES:**
   - Input the SMILES structure of the main molecule for the next steps.

2. **Select Connection Points and Amino Acids:**
   - Choose the connection point on your molecule.
   - Enter the connection point, amino acids, and any other amino acid-like molecules.
   - **Note:** Ensure that the "other molecule" can form a peptide bond to avoid errors or break esters in your structure.
   - Choose the N or C terminal of the peptides for the connection point, as it might cause errors or break esters if present in your structure.

3. **Molecule and Peptide Considerations:**
   - Ensure the connection site and the terminal make chemical sense. For example, if you are connecting the nitrogen (N) in your original molecule to the carboxyl group (COOH) in the amino acid, you should select the "C terminal" as in the C in the COOH of the peptide.
   - Limit your input to a total of **7 molecules** to prevent long operation times and avoid generating ligands too large for docking. **Note:** This module is not designed for docking large peptides.

## **3D Structure Retrieval**

### **Introduction**

In this section, we download the 3D structure of the receptor protein and make it ready for docking. 
 The first step in docking is to have a structure of a given target protein. While in some cases a high-quality comparative model will be used, most cases start with an experimentally (X-ray, NMR, cryoEM) solved three-dimensional structure.
In these cases, a given target protein structure can be downloaded with BioPython using a given accession ID. We can directly download this structure in `.pdb` file format.
In addition, we calculate the centroid of the chain in this step, in order to use in further calculations.


### **Steps for Getting the 3D Structure:**

1. **Enter the PDB ID and Chain or UniProt ID:**
   - You can either use the UniProt API to select the appropriate PDB file and chain, or input them directly into M01 tool.

2. **Run the Retrieval Process:**
   - After providing the required IDs, the system will download the 3D structure in `.pdb` format.
   - Additionally, the centroid of the chain is calculated to serve as the center for grid box definition in docking simulations.

## **Automated Docking**

### **Introduction**

In this section, we will walk you through the automated docking process, which involves preparing both the ligand and the receptor, and finally performing the docking simulation. The docking simulation is conducted using **Autodock Vina**, while ligand preparation is handled by **EasyDock**.

### **Steps for Automated Docking:**

1. **Preparing the Ligand with EasyDock:**
   - The ligand must be prepared for docking. You can choose to run an optional protonation step or skip it.
   - The **EasyDock** module is used to prepare the ligand, and further details are available on their [GitHub page](https://github.com/ci-lab-cz/easydock).

2. **Preparing the Receptor with MGL Tools:**
   - The receptor's PDB file is converted into PDBQT format. Hydrogens are checked, and **Gasteiger charges** are added.
   - For additional options in receptor preparation, please refer to the `prepare_receptor4.py` file from **MGLTools**.

3. **Performing the Molecular Docking Simulation:**
   - **Autodock Vina** is used to perform the docking simulation. The runtime of each simulation varies depending on the complexity of the ligand.
   - We use default settings for the grid box and docking configuration. For customization, please refer to [Vina’s documentation](https://autodock-vina.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/).

## **Calculating Molecular Descriptors**

### **Introduction**

M01 tool offers the ability to calculate various molecular descriptors using the **RDKit** module. These descriptors provide insights into the chemical properties of molecules and their potential drug-likeness. Below is a list of the descriptors calculated by M01 tool, along with simple explanations of each:

### **Available Descriptors:**

1. **Lipinski's Rule of Five (lip_score):**
   - **Purpose:** Evaluates the drug-likeness of a compound based on four key factors:
     - **Molecular Weight (exact_mw):** ≤ 500 daltons
     - **LogP (logP):** ≤ 5
     - **Hydrogen Bond Donors (hbd):** ≤ 5
     - **Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (hba):** ≤ 10
   - A score is added for each violation of these rules, and the total number of violations is calculated.

2. **Exact Molecular Weight (exact_mw):**
   - The precise mass of a molecule, calculated based on the atomic masses of its constituent atoms.

3. **LogP (logP):**
   - The logarithm of the partition coefficient (P) between n-octanol and water. This measures the compound's hydrophobicity and its ability to cross cell membranes.

4. **Hydrogen Bond Donors (hbd):**
   - The count of hydrogen atoms that can participate in hydrogen bonding by donating a hydrogen atom.

5. **Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (hba):**
   - The count of atoms capable of accepting a hydrogen

## **Functions in the LigandBuilder Class**

### **1. create_peptide_bond**
   - **Description:** Uses RDKit reactions to form a peptide bond by reacting a COOH group with a nitrogen.
